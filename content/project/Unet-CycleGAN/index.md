title: "Domain shift problem of biomedical Imaging Segmentation using UNet and GAN"
summary: "Unet, is a powerful method for medical image segmentation. However, in clinical practice, medical images are acquired from different domains/vendors and centers. The performance of a U-Net trained from a particular source domain, when transferred to a different target domain (e.g. different vendor, acquisition parameter), can drop unexpectedly. We verify a paper methodology of using CycleGAN  architecture to solve this domain shift problem."
