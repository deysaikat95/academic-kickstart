abstract: "Superpixel algorithms group pixels into perceptually meaningful regions while respecting potential object contours, and thereby can replace the rigid pixel grid structure. Though there are many state-of-the-art algorithm exists for superpixels, these are computationally heavy. SLIC superpixels algorithm on the other hand is faster and more memory
efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods. Goal of this project was to implement SLIC superpixels and check and compare the performance of this methodology on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset(BSD500) with other existing methods. "
