I am a Computer Science master's student at Virginia Tech. My current research revolves around real-time anomaly detection in representative graphs in financial domain. I am currently a part of Synergy Lab led by Dr. Wu Feng and also a Graduate Research Assistant under the same lab.

In the past, I have worked as Associate Consultant at Microsoft where I designed and developed end-to-end solutions for Microsoft's client on Dynamics 365. My undergraduate research was on swift text area detection in an image using CNN. 

Though my profile looks very tech-savvy, I like to keep in touch with the world. History, politics, climate-change and economy are some topics which I follow regularly. I also look forward to travelling and exploring different cultures(hopefully when the pandemic is over :)) .
